Sadness filled the air as the woman, distraught, was weeping. Hoping for the return of her missing daughter, Lucy, she went to the best private investigator in town, Nick.
Having the most experience in the field, Nick was said to have closed many a case deemed impossible by the locals, so a missing person was nothing out of the ordinary.
Lucy was said to have taken a train ride to the town of Danieltown, a small town in rural America that sounded like a quaint and quiet place to disappear. The train
Lucy took was rumored to be haunted, though Nick disregarded all such claims as mere superstition. However, Nick was puzzled by the town which seemingly did not exist, as it
did not show up on any maps that Nick used, it was forgotten by even official state records. Upon boarding the train that Lucy was said to have taken, the air surrounding
the locomotive was filled with a thick fog that even the brightest of lights could not permeate. A town 100 miles away took just 15 minutes to reach by this train, the fog
never once breaking during the ride. Exiting the train, Nick was left unsettled by the stillness of the station, the swiftness with which the train took off, and the revelation
that he was the only passenger to have exited after seeing nobody else on the train. He was now alone in Danieltown.
