As the fog thickened around the station, Justin crouched behind a wooden bench, his breath misting in the cold air. The train he had arrived on retuned, its windows glowing with an eerie, unnatural light. The crowd of people began to fade into obscurity. Then he saw her—Lucy. She stood there, her eyes glassy, her face vacant, as if lost in a trance.

“Lucy!” Justin called, but she didn’t respond, her gaze still distant. The townspeople, who had gathered in a tight cluster, began to move toward her, guiding her and the other figures into the fog. Their movements were slow, deliberate—like a ritual. Desperation surged through Justin, and he stepped forward, but before he could reach her, the old man who had watched him earlier turned, his face shadowed by his hat.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” he whispered, his voice slurring. “DanielTown is no place for outsiders.”

Before Justin could react, Lucy and the others vanished into the mist, swallowed by the darkness. Justin stood frozen, his heart pounding. Whatever was happening in DanielTown was more than he bargained for.
