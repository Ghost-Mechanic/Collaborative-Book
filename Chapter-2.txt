Danieltown is far from Justin's expectations. The town is surprisingly in good condition despite its empty streets and abandoned buidings. 
The few people that Justin seem to have a wall put up, only giving vague responses when asked about Alice or lying straight up by denying that they knew her.
Maybe it was his clothes or maybe it was his accent, somehow everyone knew he was an outsider. This Justin knew for sure as he was eyed with fear and suspicion.
As Justin investigates further, he meets a young woman named Evelyn who claims to have seen Alice. 
She says Alice was staying at the old Blackwood Inn on the edge of town but warns Marcus to be careful asking too many questions. 
Evelyn reveals that Hallow Junction has secrets the locals don’t want outsiders to uncover. 
Strange occurrences—people vanishing, time behaving strangely—have been happening for years, and anyone who tries to leave is never seen again.
That night, Marcus stays at the Blackwood Inn, where Alice was last seen. In his room, he finds a journal hidden under the floorboards. 
It’s Alice’s diary. Her entries describe her growing paranoia during her stay, noting that the town seemed to be watching her, and she mentioned hearing whispers at night. 
In the final entry, Alice wrote about a "midnight meeting" she had to attend, warning herself that she might not return.
