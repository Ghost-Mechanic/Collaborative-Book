Justin follows the procession through the fog, leading him to an ancient, overgrown cemetery outside the town. The shadowy figures—including Alice—gather around a large mausoleum. He watches in horror as the figures walk inside and vanish one by one. Desperate, Marcus rushes toward Alice just as she’s about to enter the mausoleum. He grabs her arm, snapping her out of the trance.
Lucy is confused and frightened but remembers bits and pieces of what happened. She explains that she was drawn into the town’s strange rituals after her arrival, losing track of time and eventually becoming part of “The Return.” The townspeople, she reveals, are not what they seem— DanielsTwon exists as a liminal space between life and death, and the train is a vessel for the souls of those who are lost, bringing them back every full moon to cross over into the afterlife.
As Lucy and Justin try to flee, the townspeople realize something is wrong. They are pursued through the fog, chased by the very figures who disembarked from the train. In a final, desperate dash, Justin and Lucy make it back to the train station just as the midnight train reappears, glowing with the same eerie light. They board the train, hoping it will take them away.
As the train pulls away from Daniels Town, the fog slowly lifts. Lucy falls asleep, exhausted, but Marcus feels uneasy. When he looks out the window, he realizes the landscape hasn’t changed. The train is looping back toward Daniels Town.
